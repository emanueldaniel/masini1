The BMW 3 Series is an entry-level luxury car manufactured by the German automaker BMW since May 1975. It is the successor to the 02 Series and has been produced in six different generations.
The first generation of 3 Series was only available as a 2-door sedan, however the model range has since expanded to include a 4-door sedan, 2-door convertible, 2-door coupé, 5-door station wagon and 5-door hatchback body styles. In 2013, the coupé and convertible models started to be badged as 4 Series, therefore the 3 Series range no longer includes these body styles.
